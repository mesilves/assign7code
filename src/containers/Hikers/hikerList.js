Yuri came from a modest upbringing and would often wear jackets that weren't thick enough to protect him from the cold temperatures of Sverdlovsk. Yuri was known for his impulsive personality. Once during a camping retreat, a bear approached their campsite and he chased it away with a hammer."

She also enjoyed taking photos, in addition to her mountaineering experience. While hiking the Eastern Sayan mountains in 1957, she was accidentally shot in the leg by a hunter. Shortly before arriving at Vizhay, Lyudila was noted as exhibiting strange behavior. Some theorists speculate whether or not she had a sense of impending doom about the hike."

He came from an upper class background with influential parents. At UPI, he studied construction and hydraulics handworked at a secret nuclear facility after graduating from college. This fact would be important during the investigation of the group's deaths: he was found with radioactivity on his clothes, but this was from a radioactive leak he was sent to clean up."

Friends called Alexander a diligent and methodical person with clear leadership qualities. Alexander worked in Moscow for a few years and then returned to Sverdlovsk. This was strange for a young adult to do at the time, as it was very prestigious to leave a small town to head to the big city."
